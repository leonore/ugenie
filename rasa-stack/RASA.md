### Steps to using the RASA Stack

```bash
cd rasa-stack
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

1. Create NLU examples
= define the user messages your bot should understand        
= define the intents and providing ways users might express them         

in nlu_data.md

2. Define the NLU model config
for us, either `spacy_sklearn` or `tensorflow_embedding` (if we get over 1000 utterances)

3. Train the model with your examples
= learn to understand what the user says
```bash
make train-nlu
```

4. Test the model
see test_file.py

---
It is possible to only get intents with steps 1-4. That's Rasa NLU.     
But Rasa Core allows the bot to follow a story. See below:     

5.  Write stories
= teaching your bot to respond      
= rasa core will train the dialogue model and predict response based on the specific state of the convo       

A story is a real conversation between a user and a bot where user inputs are expressed as intents and the responses of the bot are expressed as action names.
e.g. saying hello back:

```
## story1
* greet # lines with * are messages written by the user
   - utter_greet # lines with - are actions taken by your bot
```

In this case, all of our actions are just messages sent back to the user, like utter_greet, but in general, an action can do anything, including calling an API and interacting with the outside world (see https://rasa.com/docs/core/customactions/).

6. Define a domain
= the universe your bot lives in      
= what user inputs it should expect to get, what actions it should be able to predict, how to respond, what info to store       

in domain.yml

Rasa Coreâ€™s job is to choose the right action to execute at each step of the conversation. Simple actions are just sending a message to a user. These simple actions are the actions in the domain, which start with utter_. They will just respond with a message based on a template from the templates section. See customactions for how to build more interesting actions.

7. Train the dialogue model
```bash
make train-core
```

8. Talk to your bot
```bash
make cmdline
```
(ignore warnings)

for basic template answers.     
Right now I've only coded in basic one liner stories. Try:
```bash
hey bot!
thanks bot
im testing you
that was wrong
```
