\section{Introduction}

Software Engineering 

This paper will present our outline for our project. 

%==============================================================================
\section{Case Study Background}

The project we chose to develop is a \textbf{virtual assistant/chatbot} for the \textbf{University of Glasgow's External Relations Directorate}.

This file will soon include:
\textit{
\begin{itemize}
\item The customer organisation and background.
\item The rationale and initial objectives for the project.
\item The final software that was delivered for the customer.
\end{itemize}
}

%------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Conclusions}

In here we will explain the wider lessons that we have learned about software engineering,
We should: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Reflect on the extent to which these lessons could be generalised to other types of software project. 
\item Relate the wider lessons to others reported in case studies in the software engineering literature.
\end{itemize}
