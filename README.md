# CS01 - Virtual Assistant for UofG's External Relations

The External Relations Project is to create a **virtual assistant / chatbot** that will help answer the increasing volume of application and course enquiries at the 
University of Glasgow's External Relations Directorate.     

Our system consists of:
* an interface for users to interact with the chatbot, 
* connected to a Natural Language Understanding unit (RASA)
* which makes queries to a free-text search engine, the Elastic database
